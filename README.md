	Import Export Utility for Active Navigation and Object Importer
	--------------------------------------------------------------
This utility will process an Excel spreadsheet that is generated by Active Navigation, and produce XML-formatted Input Control Files for  OpenText Object Importer - a data migration module built into Content Server.

Quick Start:
1) Make sure you have a compatible Java on the machine on which you want to run the utility. From a command window, type java -version
You should get something like this:

java version "1.7.0_71"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.7.0_71-b14)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 24.71-b01, mixed mode)

Note: Java 8 or higher is fine.

2) If you are reading this readme.txt from within the zip file, unpack the contents to the directory of your choice;

3) Open runUtil.bat in the editor of your choice (i.e. notepad)
	a) Change JREDIR to the location of your Java runtime environment (i.e. C:\Program Files\jre7 )
	b) Change the INPUTFILE to the full path of your Active Navigation spreadsheet (i.e. D:\path\to\DND-export.xlsx) - actual filename may vary
	
3) Open a command window, and CD to the path you unzipped to in step 2);

4) Type runUtil;

That's it!!

Note that to configure the actual transformation, you can edit the properties file (in this case, DND-POC.properties). The properties
file has lots of details about what each of the settings means.
